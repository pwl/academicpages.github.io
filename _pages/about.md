I am equally a mathematician and a programmer with solid background in
physics.  I am interested in evolutionary differential equations
coming from general relativity and other physically relevant
differential equations (with a special focus on singularity formation
and asymptotic behavior).  My toolbox consists of a combination of
numerical and analytical methods, including rigorous stability proofs
via functional analysis, asymptotic analysis, adaptive numerical
methods (for both ordinary and partial differential equations),
validated numerics and more.

Programming numerical methods is a big part of my daily routine.  Over
almost 10 years I implemented and developed several numerical methods
for partial differential equations.  As I was interested in
singularity formation most of my work was devoted to adaptive
numerical schemes, such as mesh refinement.  I (re)implemented these
methods in several programming languages like C, Fortran and Julia (in
chronological order).

Recently I took some interest in the analysis of single-cell
sequencing data, which also involves a combination of numerical and
analytical methods.  In particular I work on applying approximate
Bayesian inference to single-cell genomics.
